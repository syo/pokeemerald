# Pokémon Emerald

This is a fork of the pret decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.

It builds a modified version of the following ROM:

* [**pokeemerald.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) `sha1: f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`

The goal is a QoL upgrade to the vanilla Emerald ROM

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
